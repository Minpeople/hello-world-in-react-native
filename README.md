"# hello-world-in-react-native" 

So, I'm coming back to programming! I was Ruby dev, but now would like to focus on react native. Every day I will do step-by-step something with this app.

1st day:
Set-up environment, download all resources (node, yarm, expo, react-native)
connect computer console with my github profile
create basic project with really basic files and push it to main branch
Done!

2nd day:
play with commits and branches - maybe add some colors to my app?

3rd day:
working on components
